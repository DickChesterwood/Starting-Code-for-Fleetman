# Generally the settings don't need to change! Remember, on failure
# THE FALLOVER WILL ALWAYS RUN IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE - the breaker 
# doesn't need to be open.

# breaker will even consider tripping. Default = 20 in the rolling time window

# Once the breaker does consider tripping, it decides if the number of failures
# in the rolling time window exceeds this percentage. Default 50%. (ie 0% means a single
# error will be considered a "trip" - but the above needs to be met as well).
hystrix.command.default.circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage=50 

# This is the aforementioned rolling time window. A long one will make 
# hystrix "more sensitive".  Default = 10000 (10secs)

# Despite all of the above, after the following period, the breaker will close
# Of course, it can be tripped again. Default = 5000 (5 seconds)

# The following may need to be changed. If this is exceeded, we run fallback
