# Starting-Code-for-Fleetman
This repository contains the initial code for the fleetman project. It is a poorly implemented microservice solution, with lots of hardcoding. The training course at VirtualPairProgrammers shows how to use Eureka, Ribbon, Feign, Hystrix and Spring Cloud Config to move towards a battle tested, production infrastructure.
